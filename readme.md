The point of this program was to read chipotle's tweets for their free burito promotion, then text the code to different phones so they coudl easily be copy pasted to another text to chipotle.

The main things you need are a twitter api key and an email account with securty settings turned off. You provide the program with the emails corresponding to phone numbers. Make sure to set your environment variables.
